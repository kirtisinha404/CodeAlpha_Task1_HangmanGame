Hangman Game is a classic game developed in Python.
Rules of the game are as following:
      1:The goal is to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time.
      2:For each correct guess, the letter is filled in the corresponding dash.
      3:For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, representing a man being "hanged". The figure is drawn in stages (head, body, arms, legs, etc.).
      4:The game continues until the word is completely guessed or the stick figure is fully drawn, resulting in a loss.
      5:The player has 7 tries to guess the word.
